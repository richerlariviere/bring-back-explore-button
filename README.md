Update: Github brought back the explore button. Cheers! This repo is now read-only.

# bring-back-explore-button
Bring back the "Explore" button to Github

I was so nostalgic of the "Explore" button removal so I decided to create a chrome extension to bring it back. It is my first extension for Chrome.

##Installation

1. Download repository [ZIP file](/richerlariviere/bring-back-explore-button/archive/master.zip)
2. Go to **chrome://extensions/**
3. Drag and drop the entire folder into the window
4. Be sure you have checked the *developer mode* checkbox.
5. Enjoy!

## Support

**Chrome**
Tested with Chrome 49.x

**Safari**
Thanks to dmiedema, you can have the same extension for Safari. [Project link](https://github.com/dmiedema/bring-back-explore-button)
