Bring back the "Explore" button to Github

I was so nostalgic of the "Explore" button removal so I decided to create a chrome extension to bring it back. It is my first extension for Chrome.

##Installation

1. Download repository [ZIP file](/richerlariviere/bring-back-explore-button/archive/master.zip)
2. Go to **chrome://extensions/**
3. Drag and drop the entire folder into the window
4. Be sure you have checked the *developer mode* checkbox.
5. Enjoy!
